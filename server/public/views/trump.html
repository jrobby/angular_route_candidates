    <p class="bg-trump">Donald John Trump, Sr. (born June 14, 1946) is an American business magnate, billionaire, investor,[5] socialite, author, television personality, and candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election. He is the chairman and president of The Trump Organization and the founder of Trump Entertainment Resorts. Trump's career, branding efforts, personal life, wealth, and outspoken manner have helped make him well-known.
        A native of New York City, he is the son of Fred Trump, who inspired him to enter real estate development.[6] Trump worked for his father's firm, Elizabeth Trump & Son, while studying business at Wharton, and joined the company in 1968 upon graduation.[7] In 1971, he was given control of the company, and renamed it "The Trump Organization". He has since built a number of hotels, golf courses, and other properties in Manhattan and other global cities, many of which bear his name.
        He is a major figure in the American business scene and has had prominent media exposure.[8][9][10][11] His successful NBC reality show, The Apprentice, bolstered his fame. His three marriages (the first two ending in divorce) have been the subject of considerable tabloid coverage.[12]
        On June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for president in the 2016 election, seeking the nomination of the Republican Party. His campaign has drawn more media coverage than all his Republican rivals combined,[13] which some believe has bolstered his rise in the polls.[14] Free media coverage and self-financing has allowed him to eschew the super PAC model of raising hundreds of millions dollars. Since July 2015 he has consistently been the front-runner in public opinion polls for the Republican Party nomination,[15][16][17] and frequently touts his high poll numbers.[18][19]
        According to the orthodox conservative National Review, Trump runs on a highly populist[20] platform that appeals to the concerns of working-class voters who feels displaced by job losses and changes to America's ethnic and religious demographics. He has made his opposition to political correctness and willingness to "tell it like it is" a major component of his style.[21] Trump's anti-illegal-immigration politics have earned him support among working-class voters amid widespread opposition from Hispanics, business leaders, and other Republicans.[22][23][24][25] Trump has also focused on reducing terrorism and has advocated for a complete ban on Muslim immigration, which has also produced widespread opposition.[26]
        Trump had previously toyed with the idea of running for president, and in 2000 ran an exploratory campaign and won two Reform Party primaries.[27][28]
